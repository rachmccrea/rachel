<h1>Welcome to "the most beautiful Taco Bell in the world."</h1>

<p>Twenty miles south of San Francisco, in the weathered, wave-battered beach town of Pacifica, a solitary wooden building squats on the beach. The bright purple Taco Bell Cantina sign seems jarringly out of place amid the sand dunes and surfers, but it marks one of the best places on the West Coast. </p>

<h2> let's set the scene. </h2>
</div>

<p> Separated from the famous Highway 1 by a line of rugged sand dunes, this Pacifica beach is at times as foggy as the City By The Bay. Other days, it's all blue skies, sun, and sand. A popular beginner surf spot, the waves are usually dotted with surfers of all stripes, no matter the weather. 
Entering the Taco Bell Cantina, a wave of chatter hits you. It's almost always crowded with locals, surfers, or families out for a beach day. Colorful murals line the walls, and there's a glass fire installation that seems more fit for a high-end restaurant than a Taco Bell. One of the best features is out the back door: there, a deck provides front-row seats to watch surfers catch waves. Frequently, a cheers will rise among the diners when a surfer catches a particularly gnarly ride.

<h2> why is it the best? </h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's a cantina:</strong> Cantinas are rarer than the average Taco Bell, and are coveted by those of legal age. For many surfers, there's nothing like a spiked Baja Blast in a swirly cup as tall as your arm after a long surf session.</li> 
<li> <strong>It's gorgeous:</strong> From the fire installation to the murals to the weathered wooden floorboards, this is not a greasy roadside drive-thru (though there is a walk-up window for those with sandy feet). It's a beautiful establishment in a location that's impossible to beat. Which brings us to... </li>
<li> <strong>Location, location location:</strong> You can watch surfers catch waves while enjoying your chalupa. That's rad. </li>
<li> <strong>It has novelty</strong> and is a quirky piece of Bay Area history! </li>
</ul>

<h2>fun features</h2>

<ol> 
	<li>Surfboard parking</li>
	<li>Walk-up window for surfers with sandy feet</li>
	<li>An indoor-outdoor fireplace (it's made of glass, so that guests on the deck or inside can admire the flames</li>
	<li>A range of drinks, including margaritas, the Baja Blast with a tequila shot, the Twisted Blue Rasberry Freeze, a Twisted Pina Colada, and more. <strong>Disclaimer: </strong>I've never actually had any alcohol from Taco Bell (because I am a law-abiding underage citizen), so I can't speak to their tastiness from personal experience. </li>

<h2> internet fame </h2>
</div>

<p>Though it has been a local landmark for years (the original building was built in the 60s as a hamburger restaurant) this Taco Bell went viral on TikTok in 2020, soon after being remodeled and beginning to serve alcohol in 2019. Two high school sweethearts even had their <a href="https://www.insider.com/couple-had-wedding-at-taco-bell-cantina-beach-california-photos-2021-11#garcia-said-the-cake-made-out-of-taco-bell-sauce-packets-turned-out-so-well-that-the-location-decided-to-keep-it-on-display-9">wedding reception</a> there in 2021.
