Data journalism is hard.
</p>

<p>
It’s complex, full of intricacies to unravel. To the young journalist, trying to find the story buried within a spreadsheet can be intimidating and overwhelming. 
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, the same can be said about university sustainability efforts. Complicated and technical, the world of greenhouse gas accounting is a data-heavy field not for the faint of heart.  
</p>

<p>
I discovered this all very quickly when I started researching the University of Maryland’s greenhouse gas emissions for a final project. My idea was simple: how do UMD’s greenhouse gas emissions compare to those of other schools in the area? 
</p>

<p>
The process also seemed simple: choose a few of the biggest schools in the region, find their emissions data online, and use a handy spreadsheet to see how they compare to UMD. Easy and straightforward, right? 
</p>

<p>
Not quite. 
</p>

<p>
I started my investigation wide-eyed, naive, and ready to rock, but my problems began the moment I tried to choose which schools to compare. Do local community colleges count? What about satellite campuses? Is there a difference between the emissions of private and public schools? Do enrollment numbers matter? Where do I even find all this data? 
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I forged ahead. I chose five schools (including UMD) with student bodies of 10,000 or larger and began to search for more information. Again, more problems arose. Howard University is in the middle of completing their sustainability plan and has no GHG inventory available. American has offset all of its emissions and already reached carbon neutrality. Campus size varied wildly between schools, from UMD’s 1340 acres to GW’s 43. 
</p>

<p>
I was lost, but I wouldn’t admit it yet. I continued trying to compare these schools using data from multiple sources, and found that UMD had the most emissions by far of any of them. 
</p>

<p>
Well, there’s my story! UMD is a gas guzzler, a Hummer in a sea of Teslas. It needs to cut down on its emissions or suffer my journalistic wrath. 
</p>

<p>
Yeah, not really. 
</p>

<p>
I met with three members of UMD’s Office of Sustainability, who quickly put me in my place. A huge public research institution like UMD isn’t even comparable to a smaller private school like GW or American, they told me. As one of the experts put it, my current selection was like comparing apples to oranges, with a couple of walnuts thrown in there. 
</p>

<p>
Humbled, I set out again on my journey. I needed to compare apples to apples if I wanted a more well-rounded and accurate story. The Office of Sustainability crew suggested starting with a new selection of more similar schools, like ones in the BIG10 or other public research institutions. They also introduced me to the AASHE <a href="https://benchmarks.aashe.org/#tool" target="_blank">STARS benchmarking tool</a>, which allowed me to compare schools easier, quicker, and more accurately. 
</p>

<p>
But first, let’s take a quick pit stop to discuss some technicalities. 
</p>

  <ul style= "margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 15px; text-align: left;"> 
    <li> <em> All the schools I compare in this story self-report their data to <strong>AASHE, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.</strong> I used their <strong> STARS benchmarking tool </strong> to compare each school’s <strong>gross and net emissions </strong> and <strong>renewable energy usage.</strong> AASHE also awards a score out of 100 to each institution. Not every school self-reports to AASHE, which is why you won’t see schools like Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Rutgers, or Purdue included here. A more thorough examination of local and BIG10 schools might be in my future once I have a more confident grasp of the intricacies of benchmarking. </em></li>
    <br>
    <li> <em><strong>Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions </strong> are commonly measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent <strong>(MTC02E). </strong> The EPA has a handy definition <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-12/documents/ghgcalculatorhelp.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you’d like to learn more. </em></li> <!-- link to epa here -->
    <br>
    <li><em>Emissions depend on more than just a school’s size, I learned. Local climate, research, and infrastructure are some other factors determining how big of an emitter an institution is. </em></li>
    <br>
    <li><em>There are three <strong>“scopes”</strong> when talking about GHG emissions. I compare data on Scope 1 and 2 emissions in this story. Scopes 1 and 2 refer to onsite combustion and purchased energy, while Scope 3 covers indirect emissions associated with the university, like air travel and commuting. That’ll be important later when we start getting into emission reduction strategies.</em></li>

    Alright, let’s dive into the data.

  When I began my research on local schools, I got a result that looked something like this:

  But since the Office of Sustainability experts had told me that a large part of emissions are associated with buildings, I took gross building space into account. This gave me a very different picture:

    Turns out George Mason University is actually the least efficient out of these schools, and the five universities are much closer in efficiency than I previously believed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When I compared UMD to other BIG10 schools (apples to apples), I saw even more of a shift:

    When you take building space into account, UMD has some of the lowest emissions in the BIG10. It also uses the highest percentage of clean and renewable energy, and has the highest AASHE score out of all fifteen schools, clocking in at 77.34 out of 100.
  </p>
  <p> 
    That’s my story: how different data can lead to drastically different interpretations. UMD might be the biggest local emitter, but it’s the school to beat in BIG10 sustainability. 
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s due in part to the focus the university community puts on campus sustainability.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Over the years, the campus has adopted sort of a sustainable culture, you know, sort of an ethic around it,” said Scott Lupin, the director of UMD’s Office of Sustainability and one of the experts I talked to at the beginning of my adventure. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This sustainable ethic could be seen back in 2007 when UMD signed the Second Nature <a href="https://secondnature.org/wp-content/uploads/Carbon-Commitment_Charter-Signatories.pdf" target="_blank">Carbon Commitment</a>, pledging to work towards carbon neutrality.
</p>
<p> 
  This leads us into the second part of this journey: emission reduction efforts. UMD has ambitious climate pledges, committing itself to <a href="https://sustainability.umd.edu/news/umd-accelerate-carbon-neutrality-goal-2025" target="_blank">achieving carbon neutrality</a> by 2025 and <a href="https://today.umd.edu/a-welcome-and-call-to-contribute-to-solutions-to-improve-our-planet" target="_blank">eliminating fossil fuel usage</a> by 2035. Schools across the nation have made <a href="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/network/" target="_blank">neutrality commitments</a>, with students as a leading voice for sustainability. 
</p>
<p>
“Students are demanding change, and I think that’s beautiful,” said Josh Lasky, the director of George Washington University’s Office of Sustainability.
</p>
<p>
Lasky describes his general approach to emissions reduction using the acronym ARRO, which stands for “avoid, reduce, replace, offset.” Under this approach, the university tries to avoid producing unnecessary emissions, reduce emissions wherever possible, replace certain kinds of infrastructure with cleaner alternatives, and offset any residual emissions.

  <p>For Krista Bailey, the sustainable campus strategist at Penn State’s Sustainability Institute, behavioral changes on an individual level are essential to creating a system that prioritizes sustainability. </p>
  <p>“You can’t change a system if the people in it aren’t bought into it,” Bailey said.</p>
  <p>There is a growing amount of advocacy and awareness on climate issues at Penn State, with student organizers, faculty, and even student athletes stepping up to demand change.</p>
  <p>However, some things remain difficult. The concept of electrification, Bailey said, is difficult in a state that has a long history of <a href="https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Land/Mining/Pages/PA-Mining-History.aspx" target="_blank">coal mining</a> and fracking. </p>
  <p>“It's just part of our culture as a state,” she said. “It hasn’t always been pretty, but it’s been driving the economy for a long time.” </p>
  <p>Public schools like Penn State and UMD are often subject to state politics, agreed Lupin. State politics can filter down to affect university policy, and university presidents often take note of decisions made by state governors. </p>
  <p>“Maryland definitely has a really high sustainability approach in legislation,” said Emily Hightower, a sustainability coordinator at UMD’s Office of Sustainability. She added that the university has a habit of going “above and beyond” state climate legislation, like <a href="https://sustainingprogress.umd.edu/measuring-progress/carbon-neutrality" target="_blank">making 100% of its electricity purchases from renewable sources</a>.</p>
  <p>Reducing emissions at UMD is a complex beast. Keeping the heat and lights on, conducting research, fueling university transportation, and commuting all produce GHG emissions. Electrifying the entire campus isn’t on the table since much of our infrastructure is built for steam, but there are a myriad of other ways to reduce emissions.</p>
  <br>
  <blockquote style= "align: right; font-size: 20px;"><p> "You can't change a system if the people in it aren't bought into it." </p> 
    <p style= "font-size: 10px"><em> - Krista Bailey, Penn State University </em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <p>Thirty percent of the university’s electricity, and most of its heat, comes from our combined heat and power plant (CHP) on Baltimore Avenue. The remaining 70% of campus electricity comes from renewable wind and solar energy supplied through power purchase agreements (PPAs). </p>
  <p>The CHP received awards in the early 2000s for its cutting edge efficiency, said Lupin, but these days it’s “beyond its useful life.” </p>
  <p>The <a href="https://nextgen.umd.edu/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">NextGen</a> Program, still in its early stages, plans to find a solution to the CHP issue and revamp UMD’s energy systems. By conducting a decarbonization study and recommending efficiency measures, it hopes to chart a path towards a fossil-free UMD by 2035. </p>
  <p>In the meantime, UMD will offset emissions from the CHP. It is also offsetting indirect Scope 3 emissions from university-affiliated air travel and undergraduate commuting, Lupin said. </p>
  <p><a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/carbon-offsets" target="_blank">Carbon offsets</a> fund projects that reduce carbon emissions in other areas when lowering your own emissions is not an option. It’s a complicated subject within the field of sustainability. </p>
  <p>Lasky acknowledges that there will always be unavoidable emissions to offset, but thinks that they should only come after other sustainability measures are used. </p>
  <p>“Offsets are the absolute last place that I want to go with emissions reductions,” he said. “If you’re really cynical, they're a way just to sort of buy forgiveness.” </p>
  <p>Offsetting the CHP plant is necessary to meet UMD’s carbon neutrality deadline by 2025, but it is only a short-term solution, Hightower said. </p>
  <p>“[We’ll] hopefully get to the point where we have no direct emissions and we don’t need carbon offsets,” Lupin said. </p>
  <p>For now, offsets seem to be an unavoidable step on UMD’s carbon neutrality journey. And like virtually any other sustainability initiative, offsets cost money. </p>
  <p>“It’s great to have goals and strategies, but if we can’t afford to do them they’re not going to go anywhere,” Bailey said.</p>
  <p>Money, behavior change, infrastructure overhaul, technological advancements – it’s a lot to keep track of. According to SustainableUMD’s <a href="https://sustainingprogress.umd.edu/measuring-progress/carbon-neutrality" target="_blank">Progress Hub</a>, our net emissions dropped by almost 55% between 2005 and 2021. That’s a huge achievement, but is full carbon neutrality possible for big universities like ours? </p>
  <p>“It has to be,” Lasky said as he kept an eye on his one-year-old daughter. “I’m scared for her if we don’t figure this out.” </p>
  <p>What it comes down to, he said, is making sure that an institution is ready, willing, and able to make the necessary changes. </p>
